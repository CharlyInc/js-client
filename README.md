What you need to build your own Subledger JS
---

In order to build Subledger JS, you need to have Node.js/NPM latest and git 1.7 or later.
(Earlier versions might work OK, but are not tested.)

Windows users have two options:

1. Install [msysgit](https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/) (Full installer for official Git) and a
   [binary version of Node.js](http://nodejs.org). Make sure all two packages are installed to the same
   location (by default, this is C:\Program Files\Git).
2. Install [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/) (make sure you install the git and which packages), and
   a [binary version of Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

Mac OS users should install Xcode (comes on your Mac OS install DVD, or downloadable from
[Apple's Xcode site](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html)) and
[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git,
and `brew install node` to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source
if you swing that way. Easy-peasy.
